Courses and projects for data science


Here I'm documenting the courses and projects that I'm working on to launch my data science career. 

I'll first follow the Data Science Masters created by David Venturi. This uses only online resources. 
I'm commiting 10 hours per week toward this goal, starting on ##### 13 March 2018.
