Courses and projects for data science


Here I'm documenting the courses and projects that I'm working on to launch my data science career. 

I'll first follow the Data Science Masters created by David Venturi. This uses only online resources. 
I'm commiting 10 hours per week toward this goal, starting on 13 March 2018.

The aim is to do as many courses as possible by 31 July 2018, and then start work on Kaggle projects. 

I'll apply to Data Science jobs in January 2019.
